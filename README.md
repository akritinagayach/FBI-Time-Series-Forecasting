# FBI Time Series Forecasting

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for a machine learning problem using Python. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and basic result analysis. The notebook is designed as a template for quick reuse in ML competitions or projects.

##  Project Structure

- **Data Loading:** Load datasets using `pandas` and `numpy`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summary statistics and basic visualizations.
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
- **Model Training:** Use of popular models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
- **Submission Generation:** Saving predictions in a CSV file for submission.

##  Getting Started

###  Requirements

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Common packages include:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akritinagayach/FBI-Time-Series-Forecasting.git
   cd FBI-Time-Series-Forecasting
   ```

2. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ML.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells step-by-step and modify as needed for your dataset.

##  Example Output

The notebook produces:
- Accuracy and classification metrics
- Confusion matrix plots
- A downloadable CSV file containing model predictions

##  Notes

- You can replace the dataset and model according to your problem.
- This template is ideal for competitions like Kaggle or real-world prototyping.
